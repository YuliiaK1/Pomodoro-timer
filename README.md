<h2>What is the Pomodoro Technique?</h2>
The Pomodoro Technique sounds basic, but it really works. You set a timer for 25 minutes, work until it's up, then take a 5-minute breakâ€”and repeat the whole process three more times. After that, you take a 15- to 30-minute break, depending on how you feel. That's one full Pomodoro cycle.
